# weather-analytics

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless, scalable ETL pipeline that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API(https://openweathermap.org/api), processes it using Apache Spark on Google Cloud DataProc, and stores the structured data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS) in Parquet and CSV formats.
